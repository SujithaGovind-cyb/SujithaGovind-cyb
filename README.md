I am a recent cybersecurity graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solve complex problems.

## Objective

My journey in computer science started as early as in high school has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.

Sujitha Govindasamy - Cybersecurity Portfolio

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am an IT professional specializing in Digital Forensics, Incident Response (DFIR), and Security Operations (SOC). My focus is on solving complex security problems through the hands-on application of advanced tools and recognized industry frameworks.

🎓 Education & Professional Credentials

Master of Information Systems Security Management (Expected Graduation: June 2025)

Concordia University of Edmonton

Certifications:

CompTIA Security+

Microsoft Certified: Security, Compliance, and Identity (SC-900)

EC-Council Applied Data Loss Prevention (DLP) & Generative AI Fundamentals.

Research Papers: Published 4+ research papers spanning topics in AI, Blockchain, and Project Management, with three being SCOPUS-indexed.

🚀 Key Impact & Achievements

These highlights demonstrate my ability to deliver measurable results and apply advanced security concepts in practical environments.

Incident Response & Forensics (DFIR): Executed the full IR lifecycle in a simulated environment, utilizing Volatility 3 for deep memory forensics and Autopsy for hard disk analysis to reconstruct complex attack chains (e.g., privilege escalation, data exfiltration).

Security Engineering & Secure Code: Directly contributed to a 30% reduction in critical production security alerts over 12 months at Flextronics through systematic secure code review and implementation of robust input validation controls (aligned with OWASP Top 10).

Infrastructure Hardening: Designed, deployed, and secured a full Active Directory (AD) environment based on CIS Benchmarks, validating security posture with enterprise auditing tools like PingCastle.

Vulnerability Management: Led comprehensive server penetration tests using Nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit. Successfully exploited vulnerabilities (e.g., ProFTPD) and performed hash extraction with Hashcat to fully scope risk.

Operational Efficiency: Acted as front-line IT triage for 200+ hybrid enterprise users, achieving a 15% increase in Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance on high-volume ITSM tickets through process adherence.
